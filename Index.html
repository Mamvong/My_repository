A renouned company with diverse subsidiaries spreading accross diverse sectors of the nigerian economic space (agricultural sector, commercial sector, finance sector to mention but a few). Although many know Mr Mamvong as an indegene of Plateau State, there has however been divergent public opinions as to his tribe, in fact, many are still in a limbo when it comes to the subject matter.

        <h2>My Code Plateau Experience</h2>
        <p class="second"> I must confess that Code Plateau has been an amazing feet for me thus far. Being someone who was intrigued by programming and the opportunities it offers most expecially, to someone from a finance background like myself, i had embarked on a course of gathering the needed knowledge to build my desired skill set when code plateau came along.
            Learning in a corporate environment with someone to help point out yours flaws and push you up a ladder is a gift, and that is what my experience has been like within the duration of this exercise.

        <h3>Life Outside Code-Plateau</h3>
        
        <div class="third">
            well, there isn't much to say about my life outside code plateau because, primarily being an operations manager is my major preoccupation. my fulcrum however has however been the quest to be more than what i am at any point in time.
